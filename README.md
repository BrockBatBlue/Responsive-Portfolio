# Unit 02 CSS and Bootstrap Homework: Emily's Responsive Portfolio
* created 5 files - 3 html, 1 css, and 1 md
* incorporated image files into a files folder for project use

# Navbar
* created a navbar and distributed the navbar to all html pages
* changed the navbar fonts/colors and background colors
* linked all html pages to the nav-links - Brand name page and About are currently the same. I will be adding a separate home page later once I figure out the proper style and layout I would want to present. The About(index html) page is a placeholder for now.
* Made html pages bold when clicked and stays bold when on that page

# About/Emily Brockett Main Page
* Added two rows of photo and description with changes to fonts using google fonts
* Added a carousel of photos of similar sizes with minor differentiation. The minor differences will be changed later. These are generally placeholder photos.
* Added bootstrap js to all html pages for carousel movement and other interactive things such as phone enabled drop down menus.
* Added an hr between rows to separate each section with more definition

# Portfolio Page
* Added a centered title "Portfolio" in a specified Google Font
* Added two rows of Bootstrap Kitchen sink cards in three columns. This was a bit tedious as I had to rebuild the cards when reformatting them into columns while following bootstrap's instructions.
* Added placeholder photos to the cards. All description text is original to bootstrap at this time, and card links are currently dead.

# Contact Page
* Added a centered title "Contact Me" in a specified Google Font
* Separated the title section with an hr to give the form its own segment
* Created a unique form following instructions for grid forms in bootstrap, which includes First Name, Last Name, Email, and Message. This was an interesting situation as it took time to fix the centering and took extra research to get the form elements to fit properly when transformed to phone (xs) size.
* Added a "Send" button within the form container.

# Optional Sticky Footer
* This was a pain. Went to bootstrap and found the sticky footer inspector use. Used the footer contained elements only at first, then due to malfunction in the Contact page, had to add a main class with a flex-shrink-0 to make the sticky footer work correctly on all pages, as well as interactive with the phone format.
